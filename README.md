### 🌎 Context

Phytoplankton Adventure is an exciting app that immerses you in the fascinating world of phytoplankton. In this game, you take on the role of a virtual phytoplankton keeper, exploring its growth and learning about its essential role in the oceans. You will also discover how scientists study phytoplankton from space and their impact on the balance of the oceans.
