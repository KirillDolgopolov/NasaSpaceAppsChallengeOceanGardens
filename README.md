# La Aventura del Fitoplancton

### Context

Phytoplankton Adventure is an exciting app that immerses you in the fascinating world of phytoplankton. In this game, you take on the role of a virtual phytoplankton keeper, exploring its growth and learning about its essential role in the oceans. You will also discover how scientists study phytoplankton from space and their impact on the balance of the oceans.

This project was created by the Galactic Space Coders team as part of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge, with the aim of educating and raising awareness about the importance of phytoplankton, the oceans and climate change.

### Technology stack

The project has been developed using the following technologies:
 //BACKEND
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.0.5
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Spring Security for authentication
- Spring Validation for data validation
- Hibernate Core (Jakarta) for database access
- ModelMapper for object mapping
- Lombok for code simplification
- Spring Boot Devtools for development

### Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have Java 17, Gradle and MongoDB installed on your system.

2. Clone the project repository on your local machine using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/MiquelDebon/NasaSpaceAppsChallenge.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd NasaSpaceAppsChallenge

4. Create the "galacticspacecoders" database and the "users" collection in MongoDB.

5. Build the project using Gradle. Run the following command to compile and package the project:

         gradle build

6. Once the build is successful, you can run the application using the following command:

         gradle bootRun
      
//7. La aplicación estará disponible en http://localhost:8080. Puedes acceder a los puntos finales y explorar la funcionalidad utilizando herramientas como Swagger UI o tu herramienta de prueba de API preferida.

### Objectives

The objectives of the "Phytoplankton Adventure" project include:
